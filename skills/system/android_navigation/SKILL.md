# Android navigation skill

## Purpose

- Guide safe navigation outside any single app.
- Handle system dialogs, permission prompts, onboarding overlays, and app-switching surfaces consistently.

## Core rules

- Do not grant, deny, dismiss, or confirm system or app popups without explicit user approval unless the current app skill says the popup is low-risk and safe to continue automatically.
- When a modal dialog, permission prompt, onboarding surface, or account-selection screen appears, stop and ask the user what to do.
- Prefer the least-invasive interpretation of unknown popups.

## Approval gating

- Treat Android permission dialogs, notification prompts, account chooser screens, and feature-onboarding cards as approval-required.
- Summarize the popup using the top visible text and the available action labels.
- If the user approves a specific action, perform only that action and then recapture the screen.

## System navigation

- Use `back` to leave uncertain surfaces before using `home`.
- Avoid destructive system actions, account changes, or settings mutations unless the user asked for them explicitly.
